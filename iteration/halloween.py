# A Halloweâ€™en display needs a computer controlled light which will flicker. 
# Flicker the light for a random number of seconds between 1/10 and 1/100 
# of a second. You can use a pause function that takes as a parameter the 
# number of milliseconds to pause the program. For example pause(1000) 
# will pause the program for 1 second.  To turn the light on and off, 
# set the value of light to HIGH for ON and LOW for OFF.  
# The control loop should run continuously.
